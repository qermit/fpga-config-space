This is an implementation of the SDB filesystem. Such thing is a
flash-based filesystem meant to be accessed both by a soft-core
running on the FPGA and the host computer (but not at the same time).

The structure of the filesystem is read-only, but each individual file
may be read-write, based on alignment restrictions of the hosting
device.

The thing is split in three parts

    kernel/

	includes the kernel driver (filesystem and sample hw support).

    lib/

	includes the library that the soft-core can use to access its
	own flash memory.

    userspace/

	includes the gensdbfs tool and other user-space stuff that uses
	the library above.


Since SDB is used to self-describe a bus, you can even mount sdbfs
over a real bus. In this case however only mmap is allowed on the
individual files (no read or write method is there).

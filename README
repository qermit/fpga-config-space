Wishbone bus simulation in Linux. The project contains a wishbone bus 
driver, a PCI board driver (that has the wishbone bus on it) and tools
for generating the required firmware (for "faking" stuff like memory 
maps). Included are also two fake wishbone drivers.

I am currently testing this on a QEMU virtual machine (running the 
latest git kernel). The hard disk image has been made using debootstrap.
